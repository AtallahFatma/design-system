# Accessibility

Accessibility is a **first-class concern** in this design system.

It is not optional, not decorative, and not delegated to consumers.

---

## Principles

- Semantic HTML by default
- Visible labels over aria-only labels
- Errors are announced to assistive technologies
- Keyboard navigation is always supported

---

## Form accessibility

All form controls follow these rules:

- Each control has a visible `<label>`
- Labels are wired using `htmlFor` and `id`
- Errors set `aria-invalid="true"`
- Helper and error messages use `aria-describedby`

### Example

```tsx
<FormField label="Email" error="Invalid email">
  <Input type="email" />
</FormField>
```

This results in:

- Screen readers announcing the label
- Error message being read automatically
- Proper focus handling

## Keyboard navigation

- All interactive elements are keyboard reachable
- Focus states are visible
- No keyboard traps

Tested using:

- Tab / Shift+Tab
- Enter / Space
